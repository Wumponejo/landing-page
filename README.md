Project that ends the flex section of TOP

First commit: 
Just a test for the first ended versions. Modifications for it and alternatives versions will be added later, since the "copy version" is not yet absolutely
finished and versions with images and variatios of style will start soon.

A mistaken version was pushed in the first commit, which was bugged an looked as an alteranative version of the project. Now that error is solved.

Second: Now the first draft of the copy is ended. Keeps being far from being perfect, having problems of element localization in the first section and confusion
with the use of some fonts in texts all along the page. But it has all the elements initially required an it's similar enough to the provided image, so it counts
in respect to what was stated in TOP (that it only needs to be similar, not necessarily a perfect reproduction).

The following commits will be attempts to make a more allegied copy to the original, focusing on little details. The Third will be declared when the alternative
page is pushed, unless some other idea results to be important enough before the alternative is finished.
