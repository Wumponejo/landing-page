Project that ends the flex section of TOP

First commit: 
Just a test for the first ended versions. Modifications for it and alternatives versions will be added later, since the "copy version" is not yet absolutely
finished and versions with images and variatios of style will start soon.

A mistaken version was pushed in the first commit, which was bugged an looke as an alteranative version of the project. Now that error is solved
